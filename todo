Done - Get a way to input a function
Done - Get the point and range
Do later - Get the color of plotted things
Test this - Get a way to raise error if not a vaid function

Next thing - Find roots using neutons method

Do numerical differentiation for the funtion

Do numerical integration using trapezoidal / adaptive rules rule

Get error of integral
Get error of derivative

Get the taylor/fourier approximation

Plot function
Plot tangent line
Plot deriv
Plot second deriv
Plot indef integral if it exists
Plot critical points
Plot max and min points
Plot integral space thingy
Plot t/f approximation

Put the text for numer. int and deriv as well as analyitical int and derivative
Also plot error, all roots, critical points, etc. in sep. graph

Make interactive controls

Make a way to save the plot
